# `isorespin.sh`

Linuxium's script to respin an Ubuntu, Ubuntu flavour, Linux Mint, neon, elementary, BackBox or Peppermint ISO and optionally add/remove functionality like kernels/packages/files, etc.

In other words, it allows Ubuntu ISO to be respun and customized ("remastered") to create a new ISO.
